#  Mobile Sales Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This Power BI dashboard analyzes mobile phone sales across different countries, customer segments, product models, sales channels, and payment methods.

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project was to uncover insights from mobile phone transaction data and visualize trends in product performance, customer behavior, and revenue distribution.

## Data Preparation & Cleaning Steps:
- Converted `Transaction_Date` to proper date format
- Extracted `End of Month` for time-based trend analysis
- Standardized categorical fields (e.g., Brand, Gender, Payment Type)
- Removed null or duplicate entries where applicable
- Created calculated columns and DAX measures for revenue, ranking, and performance metrics
